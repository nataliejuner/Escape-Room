# README

This is my first Ruby on Rails project I created at LEARN Academy. I made it originally in a mob setting, but then later finished it on my own. It is a pretty straight forward game but still takes some thinking to be able to survive the game!

You can visit the demo of the project here: [Escape Room](https://escape-room-learn2019.herokuapp.com/)
